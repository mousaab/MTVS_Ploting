## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mousaab/MTVS_Ploting.git
   cd multivariate-time-series-plotter
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your multivariate time series data in a CSV file or any other supported format.
2. Choose a plotting script from the `scripts` directory that suits your data visualization needs.
